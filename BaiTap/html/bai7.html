          muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80
          muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at
          the corner of the eyes an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles
          perfotmed without the eye cntraction may be perceived as insincere.
