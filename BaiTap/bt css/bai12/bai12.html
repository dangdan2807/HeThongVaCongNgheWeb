                Cascading Styles Sheets is a style language used for describing the look and
                formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to
                change the style of web pages and user interest written in HTML and XHTML, the
                language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG, and
                language XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used
                by most websites to create visually engaging webpage, used interfaces for web
                applications, and used interfaces for many mobile applications.
